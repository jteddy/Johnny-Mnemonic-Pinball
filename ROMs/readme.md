Changes from revision 0.4:

        Added a cyberspace multiball lamp effect.
    
        Fixed a condition where the left diverter did not always open
        following a ball plunge into the jets.
    
        Fixed a condition where following the first Cyberspace Multiball,
        the hand popper shot call arrow would be lit for no reason.
    
        Changed the throwing spikes to carry from ball-to-ball until they
        are completed the first time.
    
        Can now cancel buy-in on the launch button.
    
        Added a game over lamp effect.
    
        Corrected a display error where at game over with multiple players,
        a portion of the final player up's score would be partially wiped
        away.
    
        Added (non Tournament) hand cabinet button cheat codes. 
    
        Changed touch tone multiball jackpot rules to be worth the effort of
        making the shots.
    
        Now the hand is moved to the back during game over to improve the
        chances of the hand being in an optimal position for shipment.
    
        If we determine the hand to be broken, and we are trying to clear
        the hand popper (except in multiball) the diverter is opened to give
        the ball additional room to exit.
    
        Fixed a condition where the game over music would terminate
        prematurely.
    
        Improved flaky ball-in-hand switch behavior.
    
        Changed hand popper behavior to switch to a soft kick after failing
        to clear, when the hand is not marked bad.
